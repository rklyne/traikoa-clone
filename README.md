# A clone of the Traikoa API.

This supports the functionality of the removed `traikoa_rb` project through a django app and simple rest views.

## Usage
It's a normal django app. Install it in the normal django way.

## Setup

This thing needs data.

Go to https://eddb.io/api and grab `systems_populated.json`. Load that with `./manage.py load_system_json --file systems_populated.json`
